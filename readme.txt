(why you chose each dependency)
1. Volley
I chose Volley rather than Retrofit, because Volley provides network image handling support.
But in the end, I used Glide rather than ImageLoader + NetworkImageView of this library.

2. Glide
I used this library to show book-covers to the users. I prefer Glide to Picasso because of its fast-loading speed.

(Please specify in the readme what your next steps would have been if the allocated time was 4 hours instead of 2. )
*If I had more time, I would use Volley to show book-covers.
*Using ImageLoader of Volley worked, but whenever I scrolled the screen, the book covers were changed constantly and 
I did not have time to make it better. So I decided to use Glide.

I would show more information of the books, if I had more time.
Then I could offer several sorting-ways.
